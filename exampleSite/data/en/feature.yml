      content : The worldwide use of the Internet and online social networking has transformed the constraints of time and space in human interaction: we can now be heard at a massive scale unprecedented in human
history. Moreover, information technologies enable individuals to organize and interact with their governments both through direct assembly and collective action at a scale and efficacy never seen
before. In particular, civic technology, civic tech for short, has emerged to improve the relationship with governments by providing data access and visualization tools, voting services, and participatory
budgeting platforms, just to mention some examples. Our research concerns this opportunity to leverage a new sort of political life. We focus specifically on how software systems may enable
participatory democracy, that is, the participation of individuals in democratic assembly, action, and governance

The focus of this research is to overcome such a challenge by leveraging and further adapting techniques that have proven successful in open source software development.
