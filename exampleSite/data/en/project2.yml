  subtitle : Collaborative Editing for Large Scale Online Citizen Participation
  content : >
    A key challenge of Civic Tech lies in providing digital tools enabling individuals to engage in participatory processes through the
    collaborative edition of proposals on topics that matter to society. The focus of this research is to overcome such a challenge by leveraging and
    further adapting techniques that have proven successful in open source software development. Toward this objective, the first step was to analyze
    a citizen consultation to identify issues concerning participation and to propose recommendations to solve the aforementioned issues. Visit the
    dedicated [GitHub project](https://github.com/repnumanalysis/repnum_notebooks) to know more.
